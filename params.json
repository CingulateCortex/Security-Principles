{"name":"Security-principles","tagline":"","body":"Security-Principles\r\n===================\r\n\r\n\r\nOver the course of my career, I have come across and collected a number of security 'aphorisms.'  These aphorisms constitute the fundamental principles of information security.  \r\n\r\nNone of the ideas or truths are mine and unfortunately, I did not collect the citations. I would like to identify the correct citations for each aphorism. Additionally, many are restatements of the same idea; thus the 'collection of ideas' defines a fundamental principle. As such, I would also like to reverse engineer the principles from the aphorisms where appropriate as well.\r\n\r\nThe end goal is to identify and cite and document the fundamental principles of information security.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

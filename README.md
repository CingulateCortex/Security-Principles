Security-Principles
===================


Over the course of my career, I have come across and collected a number of security 'aphorisms.'  These aphorisms constitute the fundamental principles of information security.  

None of the ideas or truths are mine and unfortunately, I did not collect the citations. I would like to identify the correct citations for each aphorism. Additionally, many are restatements of the same idea; thus the 'collection of ideas' defines a fundamental principle. As such, I would also like to reverse engineer the principles from the aphorisms where appropriate as well.

The end goal is to identify and cite and document the fundamental principles of information security.
